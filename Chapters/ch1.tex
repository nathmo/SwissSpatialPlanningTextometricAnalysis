\subsection{Research Questions}

To what extent do Swiss territorial / spatial planning documents acknowledge the distinction between perceived time vs measured/travel-time objectively modelled, in relation to modal choice?

How strongly do Swiss planning documents incorporate human / behavioral / motility-based rationales, as opposed to purely economic / efficiency rationales, in shaping transport and spatial policy?
