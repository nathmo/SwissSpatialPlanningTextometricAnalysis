	abstract = {One of the most significant current discussions in climate change is around the issue of low carbon emission and its effect on human health. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the transport share of world emissions. Recent developments in this field have heightened the need for Driving Cycle establishment in order to understand and reduce vehicle emissions. However, a major problem with this Driving Cycle characteristic is that it varies from one city to another due to the type of principle activities (industrial, agricultural) present. Therefore, individual testing is necessary for each region in order to establish a representative tool for Local Authorities to identify the air quality in terms of traffic emissions. To date, there has been little discussion about Driving Cycle developments, so in this paper, experimental studies, which predict sufficient parameters in driving cycle modelling, were summarized in the literature review and gave comprehensive feedback to the field for further investigations. Subsequently, the author presented a simple method for establishing the driving cycle, and estimating vehicle emission. As COPERT software is one of the most commonly deployed tools in Europe, the methodology involved a formula that is being obtained from COPERT. Later this formula is being used in a program which makes use of bulk traffic movements and average vehicle speeds in order to estimate emissions. The combination of On-board diagnostic data extraction incorporated in all modern passenger cars and program used to allow real world vehicular activities to be recorded, in order to better estimate the contribution of private cars to local emissions inventories. Representative driving cycles reflecting the real-world driving conditions of two cities were proposed and estimated vehicle emissions were compared with measured results.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rolling_resistance&oldid=1270109400},
	abstract = {Rolling resistance, sometimes called rolling friction or rolling drag, is the force resisting the motion when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface. It is mainly caused by non-elastic effects; that is, not all the energy needed for deformation (or movement) of the wheel, roadbed, etc., is recovered when the pressure is removed. Two forms of this are hysteresis losses (see below), and permanent (plastic) deformation of the object or the surface (e.g. soil). Note that the slippage between the wheel and the surface also results in energy dissipation. Although some researchers have included this term in rolling resistance, some suggest that this dissipation term should be treated separately from rolling resistance because it is due to the applied torque to the wheel and the resultant slip between the wheel and ground, which is called slip loss or slip resistance. In addition, only the so-called slip resistance involves friction, therefore the name "rolling friction" is to an extent a misnomer.
Analogous with sliding friction, rolling resistance is often expressed as a coefficient times the normal force. This coefficient of rolling resistance is generally much smaller than the coefficient of sliding friction.
Any coasting wheeled vehicle will gradually slow down due to rolling resistance including that of the bearings, but a train car with steel wheels running on steel rails will roll farther than a bus of the same mass with rubber tires running on tarmac/asphalt. Factors that contribute to rolling resistance are the (amount of) deformation of the wheels, the deformation of the roadbed surface, and movement below the surface. Additional contributing factors include wheel diameter, load on wheel, surface adhesion, sliding, and relative micro-sliding between the surfaces of contact. The losses due to hysteresis also depend strongly on the material properties of the wheel or tire and the surface. For example, a rubber tire will have higher rolling resistance on a paved road than a steel railroad wheel on a steel rail. Also, sand on the ground will give more rolling resistance than concrete. Soil rolling resistance factor is not dependent on speed.},

	abstract = {Biography
Prof.Dr.Ir. Arnold van Huis worked from 1974 to 1979 in Nicaragua for the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations on integrated pest management (IPM) in foodgrains. From 1982 to 1985 he coordinated from Niger a regional crop protection training project for eight Sahelian countries. From 1985 onwards he works as tropical entomologist at Wageningen University, the Netherlands, and has been responsible for a number of IPM and biological control projects in the tropics. He currently coordinates an interdisciplinary project in Benin, Ghana and Mali entitled "Convergence of Sciences". He also coordinates a project in the Netherlands called "Sustainable Production of Insect Proteins". This project explores the potential of the sustainable production of high quality edible insects and insect-derived products, in particular proteins, from side streams (organic waste). He also serves as a consultant to FAO on insects as food and feed.

Talk description
As the first author of "Het insectenkookboek" Arnold van Huis will try to convince the audience to eat insects. They are not only very healthy (because of the proteins), but also delicious! Producing insects as mini-livestock has many advantages over the production of conventional meat. In tropical countries close to 2000 insect species are consumed, e.g. in Mexico they like roasted ants, in Thailand they eat giant water bugs, and in Japan they eat wasps. So why not here! Do you know where you can buy insects, which ones you can eat and how to prepare them? Listen to the Talk of Van Huis and discover a whole new world of food.

	abstract = {Food consumption plays an important role in health, and understanding the process of food choice is central to health promotion. A person's life-course transitions and trajectories (persistent thoughts, feelings, strategies, and actions over the lifespan) are fundamental influences on the development of his or her personal system for making food choices.This analysis used a life-course perspective to examine influences on the fruit and vegetable choices of adults. A purposive, multiethnic sampleof86 adultsin one U.S. city participated in semistructured in-depth interviews about their life course, food choices, and influences on fruit and vegetable consumption. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts,using a grounded theory approach based on the constant comparativemethod, revealed that past life-course events and experiences were strong influences on present systems for fruit and vegetable choices. Lifecourse transitions, especially role changes and health events, placed people on relatively stable dietary trajectories that shaped current food choices. Most people experienced a few major transitions that influenced their fruit and vegetable choices, some being abrupt and some more gradual changes in their trajectories. A life-course model of a food choice trajectory was developed from the data to reflect how past events and experiences were operationalized in present contexts to shape food choices. Key influences on the trajectory included food upbringing, roles, health, ethnic traditions, resources, location, and the food system.A life-course perspective on food choice provides unique insights that reveal how past events interact with current environments to both enable and limit current health behaviors such as food choices.},

	abstract = {Objective: Food choice is a process through which people think, feel, and eat food. It does not only influence individuals' health and well-being, families and communities, but also it has an effect on regional, national, and global levels. This qualitative study was conducted to explore perceptions and lived experiences of Tehran adult residents on psychological, social and cultural determinants of food choice.
Method: In this qualitative design, we recruited 33 adults aged 30 to 64 years from various districts of Tehran, capital of Iran, and we explored how people make decisions about food choice in practice and shape their perception, attitude, and eating practices. An individual in-depth semi-structured interview guide included major questions with follow-up probes was used to explore participants’ current and past eating habits from childhood to adulthood, dietary change at different life courses, and effective psychological state on food selection in different seasons.
Results: This study revealed that food choice in the studied adults (30-64 years old) was widely influenced by psychological, social, and cultural determinants, which can be categorized into 5 main themes: cultural context and patterns; social Structure and norms; information resources and media; household and family structure; and nutrition transition.
Conclusion: The findings clarified the importance of social and cultural contexts, which influence the food choice of adults in a metropolis like Tehran. Many of these concepts are contextualized from childhood. These findings could serve as guideline to design socio-culturally appropriate strategies and improve dietary behaviors of Iranians.},

	abstract = {A lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables (F\&Vs) is associated with consumption of fewer F\&Vs and higher risk of obesity, especially for lower-income individuals. It is widely believed that the addition of new food retail opportunities could improve F\&V consumption and subsequently reduce the chronic disease burden. Observational studies provide some support for these hypotheses, but contradictions exist. In this study we sought to examine if the introduction of a food retailer affects F\&V consumption in lower-income communities. We used a systematic PRISMA approach to conduct this study. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses for academic journal references and gray literature published before August 2018. Included studies were those looking at the effect of the introduction of a new food retailer on F\&V consumption. Studies were also categorized based on which dimensions of food access were targeted by the food retailer. We identified 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria: 11 studies reported a positive increase in F\&V consumption attributable to the introduction of a new food retailer, of which 6 were statistically significant. The remaining 4 studies, all of which examined the impact of introducing a new retail supermarket, showed no change or a decrease in F\&V intake. Results from studies which change the food environment generally support the idea that increased access to healthy food improves diet, but more studies are needed in order to assess the differences between the various types of retailers, and to identify strategies for improving impact. Understanding which types of new food retail programs are most likely to impact diet has implications for policies which incentivize new food retail.},

In some countries, they are also endorsed by local authorities and institutions which support small and environmentally-friendly vehicles. In this paper, several general considerations on quadricycles will be provided including the vehicle classification, evolution of regulations (as homologation, driver licence, emissions, etc), technical characteristics, safety requirements, most relevant investigations, and other additional useful information (e.g. references, links). It represents an important and actual topic of investigation for designers and manufacturers considering that the new EU regulation on the approval and market surveillance of quadricycles will soon enter in force providing conclusive requirements for functional safety environmental protection of these promising vehicles.},

An active suspension system attempts to overcome these compromises to provide the best performance for vehicle control. Different types of mathematical models have been used to study the suspension system of a vehicle. The quarter vehicle model is used for initial investigation. Later, the half vehicle and full vehicle models are used for the study, which is closer to the actual model of a vehicle suspension. In this paper, the behavior of a suspension system is analyzed using the full vehicle model. In the current work, the dynamic equation and their state-space formulation are presented for the full vehicle model to understand the system prior to the controller design. The open-loop response of the full vehicle suspension system, when subjected to various road excitations, is also studied. The procedure of modeling a SIMULINK model for passive suspensions system is discussed in detail. Design of the simple Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) feedback and feed-forward controller is presented for the active suspension system using transfer functions. Closed-loop transfer functions are also derived and their responses are plotted. To analyze the rollover behavior simulation for cornering is also performed in the current study.},

	abstract = {An active suspension is a type of automotive suspension that uses an onboard control system to control the vertical movement of the vehicle's wheels and axles relative to the chassis or vehicle frame, rather than the conventional passive suspension that relies solely on large springs to maintain static support and dampen the vertical wheel movements caused by the road surface. Active suspensions are divided into two classes: true active suspensions, and adaptive or semi-active suspensions. While adaptive suspensions only vary shock absorber firmness to match changing road or dynamic conditions, active suspensions use some type of actuator to raise and lower the chassis independently at each wheel.
These technologies allow car manufacturers to achieve a greater degree of ride quality and car handling by keeping the chassis parallel to the road when turning corners, preventing unwanted contacts between the vehicle frame and the ground (especially when going over a depression), and allowing overall better traction and steering control. An onboard computer detects body movement from sensors throughout the vehicle and, using that data, controls the action of the active and semi-active suspensions. The system virtually eliminates body roll and pitch variation in many driving situations including cornering, accelerating and braking. When used on commercial vehicles such as buses, active suspension can also be used to temporarily lower the vehicle's floor, thus making it easier for passengers to board and exit the vehicle.},

	title = {Including cold-start emissions in the {Real}-{Driving} {Emissions} ({RDE}) test procedure},
	abstract = {The European Union implemented in 2016 the first two packages of the Real-Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure as Regulations 2016/427 and 2016/646. The third regulatory RDE package addressing cold-start emissions, the testing of hybrid vehicles, and the measurement of particle number emissions was approved by a technical committee of experts from Member States in December 2016. During the stakeholder consultations on the third RDE package, several options for the inclusion of cold-start into the RDE test procedure were discussed. Member States supported a simple inclusion of the cold-start period into the normal RDE data evaluation. The Joint Research Centre, by contrast, proposed a separate calculation of distance-specific pollutant emissions for (i) the cold-start period and (ii) the warm-engine operation and a subsequent weighting of the resulting emissions by a factor that accounts for the distance typically driven by vehicle users between two consecutive cold starts.
The objective of this report is to document two independent analyses conducted by the JRC in support of the RDE stakeholder consultations on cold start. First, we conduct a scoping review of cold-start frequencies and trip distances in Europe. Second, we conduct a scenario analysis to investigate the effect of modifications in the RDE data pre-processing and evaluation procedures on the calculated NOX emissions for urban driving. This analysis is based on actual on-road NOX emissions data obtained from vehicle tests conducted at the JRC.
The reviewed driving data obtained from seven major sources suggest that some 27 ± 5\% of trips are driven in Europe after vehicle parking of at least 3 to 8 h and may thus contain a cold start. Based on all collected data, the average driving distance between two consecutive cold starts reaches 36 ± 16 km (mean) and 30 ± 13 km (median), respectively. If only urban trips are considered, the distance between two consecutive cold starts reaches 25 ± 16 km (mean) and 27 ± 8 km (median), respectively. These findings are, in the strict sense, valid for the relatively conservative assumption that cold starts occur after a minimum parking duration of 3-8 h. Given the heterogeneity of temperature and driving conditions across the European continent, cold-starts may occur in real-word driving after longer/shorter parking durations, e.g., if the engines and after-treatment systems are thermally encapsulated/if vehicle operation occurs at ambient temperatures lower than 15oC.
The inclusion of cold start into the normal RDE data evaluation for 7 on-road trips yields both higher and lower overall urban NOX emissions, although all tested vehicles show higher NOX emissions during cold start than during warm-engine operation. This observation suggests that a simple inclusion of cold start into the normal RDE data evaluation may not capture cold start NOX emissions in a robust manner. Modifications of (i) the data pre-processing (duplication of cold-start phase or change in the order of emission events) and (ii) the weighting of moving averaging windows (assuming a constant or linearly decreasing weighting factor for windows containing cold-start emissions) each increases on average the overall urban NOX emissions but may also result for individual tests in decreasing NOX emissions relative to the exclusion of cold start from the RDE evaluation. However, a combination of modifications in the RDE data pre-processing and evaluation might capture at least part of the incremental cold-start emissions.
We regard our findings as robust. Yet, a more systematic collection and assessment of driving data and an expansion of the scenario analysis covering more tests and vehicles could complement the findings presented here.},

	abstract = {The aim of this report is twofold. First, to analyse individual (driver) mobility data to obtain fundamental statistical parameters of driving patterns for both conventional and electric vehicles. In doing so, the information contained in large mobility datasets is condensed into compact and concise descriptions through modelling observed (experimental) distributions of mobility variables by expected theoretical distributions. Specifically, the stretched exponential distribution is shown to model rather accurately the distribution of single-trips and their duration, and the scale-invariant power-law with exponential cut-off the daily mobility length, the distance travelled per day. We argue that the theoretical-distribution parameters depend on the road-network topology, terrain topography, traffic, points of interest, and individual activities. Data from conventional vehicles suggest three approximate daily driving patterns corresponding to weekday, Saturday and Sunday driving, the latter two being rather similar. Work trips were found to be longer than average and of longer duration. The second aim is to ascertain, via the limited electric-vehicle data available from the EU-funded Green eMotion project, whether the behaviour of drivers of conventional vehicles differs from the behaviour of drivers of electric vehicles. The data suggest that electric vehicles are driven for shorter distances and shorter duration. Data from the Green eMotion project showed that the median real-life energy consumption of a typical segment A, small-sized, electric car, for example the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and its variants, is 186 Wh/km with a spread of 55 Wh/km. The real-driving energy consumption (per km) was determined to be approximately 38\% higher than the type-approved consumption. Moreover, we found considerable dependence of the energy consumed on the ambient temperature. The median winter energy consumption per kilometre was higher than the median summer consumption by approximately 40\%. The data presented in this report can be fundamental for subsequent analyses of infrastructure requirements for electric vehicles and assessments of their potential contribution to energy, transport, and climate policy objectives.},

    abstract = {Physical activity has been widely associated with beneficial health effects. The use of electric-assist bicycles (e-bikes) can lead to increased or decreased physical activity, depending on the transport mode substituted. This study aimed to compare physical activity levels of e-bikers and conventional bicycle users (cyclists) as well as across e-bike user groups based on the transport mode substituted by e-bike. Physical activity, transport and user related parameters were analysed. Data from the longitudinal on-line survey of the PASTA project were used. The survey recruited over 10,000 participants in seven European cities. Physical activity levels, measured in Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET min/wk), were similar among e-bikers and cyclists (4463 vs. 4085). E-bikers reported significantly longer trip distances for both e-bike (9.4 km) and bicycle trips (8.4 km) compared to cyclists for bicycle trips (4.8 km), as well as longer daily travel distances for e-bike than cyclists for bicycle (8.0 vs. 5.3 km per person, per day, respectively). Travel-related activities of e-bikers who switched from cycling decreased by around 200 MET min/wk., while those switching from private motorized vehicle and public transport gained around 550 and 800 MET min/wk. respectively. Therefore, this data suggests that e-bike use leads to substantial increases in physical activity in e-bikers switching from private motorized vehicle and public transport, while net losses in physical activity in e-bikers switching from cycling were much less due to increases in overall travel distance.},

While the data indicate that the assumptions have a foundation, the effects on the group surveyed are not as powerful as assumed. However, as students are an atypical group in several significant aspects, the results should only be transferred to non-student groups with some caution.},

The motion performed by each test subject was recorded by means of a VHS recorder and an ELITE motion measurement system. A statistical analysis was performed on the data from the questionnaires and comfort rankings were produced for the various configurations. The most influential design parameters were identified and iso-comfort surfaces were defined and fitted which provided a simple means of quantifying the effect of one of the main parameters.},

Two preliminary studies were first performed in order to 1/ define the main driver/car interactions so as to allow measuring the contact forces at all possible contact zones and 2/ identify the design parameters that mainly influence the discomfort. In order to verify the feasibility of the protocol, a laboratory study was carried out, during which two subjects tested two car configurations. The experimental equipment was composed of a variable car mock-up, an optoelectronic motion tracking system, two 6D-force plates installed on the ground next to the doorframe and on the car floor, a 6D-Force sensor between the steering wheel and the steering column, and two pressure maps on the seat. Motions were reconstructed from measured surface markers trajectories using inverse kinematics. Joint loads were calculated by an inverse dynamic approach using a recursive Newton-Euler procedure. The validation of the computing method and the relevance of a dynamic approach are also discussed.},

    abstract = {Electrically-assisted bicycles (E-bikes) may broaden cycling to a wider spectrum of users, territories, and trips. But what are e-bike users’ experiences of safety in a low-cycling city, and how do they vary among different users? This paper conceptualizes perceived safety based on vélomobility as the meeting point between users with specific characteristics (age, gender, etc.) and an environment more or less amenable to cycling. It is based on data from a survey of 1260 e-bike users who received a subsidy in Lausanne, Switzerland. We use 13 variables to measure perceived safety, finding 3 components: comfort for cycling in different situations, satisfaction with cycling conditions, and barriers to e-bike use. Based on these components, we identify four groups of e-bike users: (1) confident all-rounders, (2) recreational on-roaders, (3) worried traffic-avoiders and (4) unconfident path-users. We find gender and age to be the main factors associated with being a member of a group with lower perceived safety. Low weekly frequency of e-bike use, reduced winter e-bike use, and cycling for recreational trips exclusively also reduce perceived safety. Despite the benefits of electrical assistance compared to conventional bicycles, low safety due to unwelcoming road conditions remains a major concern for many e-bike users.},
